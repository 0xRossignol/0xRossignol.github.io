These characteristics represent a pure approach to object-oriented programming:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Everything is an object</strong>. Think of an object as a fancy variable; it stores data, but you can “make requests” to that object, asking it to perform operations on itself. In theory, you can take any <em>conceptual(概念性的 )</em> component in the problem you’re trying to solve (dogs, buildings, services, etc.) and represent it as an object in your program.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages</strong>. To make a request of an object, you “send a message” to that object. More concretely, you can think of a message as a request to call a method that belongs to a particular object.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Each object has its own memory made up of other objects</strong>. Put another way, you create a new kind of object by making a package containing existing objects. Thus, you can build complexity into a program while hiding it behind the simplicity of objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Every object has a type</strong>. <em>Using the parlance(按照这种说法 )</em>, each object is an instance of a class, in which “class” is synonymous with “type.” The most important distinguishing characteristic of a class is “What messages can you send to it?”</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages</strong>. This is actually a loaded statement, as you will see later. Because an object of type “circle” is also an object of type “shape,” a circle is guaranteed to accept shape messages. This means you can write code that talks to shapes and automatically handle anything that fits the description of a shape. This substitutability is one of the powerful concepts in OOP.</p>
<hr/></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-2-An-object-has-an-interface"><a href="#1-2-An-object-has-an-interface" class="headerlink" title="1.2 An object has an interface"></a>1.2 An object has an interface</h3><p>Since a class describes a set of objects that have identical characteristics (data elements) and behaviors (functionality), a class is really a data type because a floating point number, for example, also has a set of characteristics and behaviors. The difference is that a programmer defines a class to fit a problem rather than being forced to use an existing data type that was designed to represent a unit of storage in a machine. You extend the programming language by adding new data types specific to your needs. The programming system welcomes the new classes and gives them all the care and type checking that it gives to built-in types. </p>
<p>The object-oriented approach is not limited to building simulations. Whether or not you agree that any program is a simulation of the system you’re designing, the use of OOP techniques can easily reduce a large set of problems to a simple solution. </p>
<p>Once a class is established, you can make as many objects of that class as you like, and then manipulate those objects as if they are the elements that exist in the problem you are trying to solve. Indeed, one of the challenges of object-oriented programming is to create a one-toone mapping between the elements in the problem space and objects in the solution space. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-3-An-object-provides-services"><a href="#1-3-An-object-provides-services" class="headerlink" title="1.3 An object provides services"></a>1.3 An object provides services</h3><p>While you’re trying to develop or understand a program design, one of the best ways to think about objects is as “service providers.” Your program itself will provide services to the user, and it will accomplish this by using the services offered by other objects. Your goal is to produce (or even better, locate in existing code libraries) a set of objects that provide the ideal services to solve your problem. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-4-The-hidden-implementation"><a href="#1-4-The-hidden-implementation" class="headerlink" title="1.4 The hidden implementation"></a>1.4 The hidden implementation</h3><p>It is helpful to break up the playing field into <em>class creators</em> (those who create new data types) and <em>client programmers</em> (the class consumers who use the data types in their applications). The goal of the client programmer is to collect a toolbox full of classes to use for rapid application development. The goal of the class creator is to build a class that exposes only what’s necessary to the client programmer and keeps everything else hidden. Why? Because if it’s hidden, the client programmer can’t access it, which means that the class creator can change the hidden portion at will without worrying about the impact on anyone else. The hidden portion usually represents the tender insides of an object that could easily be corrupted by a careless or uninformed client programmer, so hiding the implementation reduces program bugs. </p>
<p>Java uses three explicit keywords to set the boundaries in a class: <strong>public</strong>, <strong>private</strong>, and <strong>protected</strong>. These access specifiers determine who can use the definitions that follow. <strong>public</strong> means the following element is available to everyone. The <strong>private</strong> keyword, on the other hand, means that no one can access that element except you, the creator of the type, inside methods of that type. <strong>private</strong> is a brick wall between you and the client programmer. Someone who tries to access a <strong>private</strong> member will get a compile-time error. The <strong>protected</strong> keyword acts like <strong>private</strong>, with the exception that an inheriting class has access to <strong>protected</strong> members, but not <strong>private</strong> members. Inheritance will be introduced shortly. </p>
<p>Java also has a “default” access, which comes into play if you don’t use one of the aforementioned specifiers. This is usually called <em>package access</em> because classes can access the members of other classes in the same package (library component), but outside of the package those same members appear to be <strong>private</strong>. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-5-Reusing-the-implementation"><a href="#1-5-Reusing-the-implementation" class="headerlink" title="1.5 Reusing the implementation"></a>1.5 Reusing the implementation</h3><p>Once a class has been created and tested, it should (ideally) represent a useful unit of code. It turns out that this reusability is not nearly so easy to achieve as many would hope; it takes experience and insight to produce a reusable object design. But once you have such a design, it begs to be reused. Code reuse is one of the greatest advantages that object-oriented programming languages provide. </p>
<p>The simplest way to reuse a class is to just use an object of that class directly, but you can also place an object of that class inside a new class. We call this “creating a member object.” Your new class can be made up of any number and type of other objects, in any combination that you need to achieve the functionality desired in your new class. Because you are composing a new class from existing classes, this concept is called composition (if the composition happens dynamically, it’s usually called aggregation). Composition is often referred to as a “has-a” relationship, as in “A car has an engine.”</p>
<p>Composition comes with a great deal of flexibility. The member objects of your new class are typically <strong>private</strong>, making them inaccessible to the client programmers who are using the class. This allows you to change those members without disturbing existing client code. You can also change the member objects at run time, to dynamically change the behavior of your program. Inheritance, which is described next, does not have this flexibility since the compiler must place compile-time restrictions on classes created with inheritance. </p>
<p>Because inheritance is so important in object-oriented programming, it is often highly emphasized, and the new programmer can get the idea that inheritance should be used everywhere. This can result in awkward and overly complicated designs. Instead, <strong><u>you should first look to composition when creating new classes</u></strong>, since it is simpler and more flexible. If you take this approach, your designs will be cleaner. Once you’ve had some experience, it will be reasonably obvious when you need inheritance. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-6-Inheritance"><a href="#1-6-Inheritance" class="headerlink" title="1.6 Inheritance"></a>1.6 Inheritance</h3><p>A type does more than describe the constraints on a set of objects; it also has a relationship with other types. Two types can have characteristics and behaviors in common, but one type may contain more characteristics than another and may also handle more messages (or handle them differently). Inheritance expresses this similarity between types by using the concept of base types and derived types. A base type contains all of the characteristics and behaviors that are shared among the types derived from it. You create a base type to represent the core of your ideas about some objects in your system. From the base type, you derive other types to express the different ways that this core can be realized. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-7-Interchangeable-objects-with-polymorphism"><a href="#1-7-Interchangeable-objects-with-polymorphism" class="headerlink" title="1.7 Interchangeable objects with polymorphism"></a>1.7 Interchangeable objects with polymorphism</h3><p>The compiler cannot make a function call in the traditional sense. The function call generated by a non-OOP compiler causes what is called <em><u>early binding</u></em>, a term you may not have heard before because you’ve never thought about it any other way. It means the compiler generates a call to a specific function name, and the runtime system resolves this call to the absolute address of the code to be executed. In OOP, the program cannot determine the address of the code until run time, so some other scheme is necessary when a message is sent to a generic object. </p>
<p>To solve the problem, object-oriented languages use the concept of <em><u>late binding</u></em>. When you send a message to an object, the code being called isn’t determined until run time. The compiler does ensure that the method exists and performs type checking on the arguments and return value, but it doesn’t know the exact code to execute. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-8-The-singly-rooted-hierarchy"><a href="#1-8-The-singly-rooted-hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="1.8 The singly rooted hierarchy"></a>1.8 The singly rooted hierarchy</h3><p><strong><u>All objects in a singly rooted hierarchy have an interface in common, so they are all ultimately the same fundamental type.</u></strong> The alternative (provided by C++) is that you don’t know that everything is the same basic type. From a backward-compatibility standpoint this fits the model of C better and can be thought of as less restrictive, but when you want to do full-on objectoriented programming you must then build your own hierarchy to provide the same convenience that’s built into other OOP languages. And in any new class library you acquire, some other incompatible interface will be used. It requires effort (and possibly multiple inheritance) to work the new interface into your design. Is the extra “flexibility” of C++ worth it? If you need it—if you have a large investment in C—it’s quite valuable. If you’re starting from scratch, other alternatives such as Java can often be more productive. </p>
<p>All objects in a singly rooted hierarchy can be guaranteed to have certain functionality. You know you can perform certain basic operations on every object in your system. All objects can easily be created on the heap, and argument passing is greatly simplified. </p>
<p>A singly rooted hierarchy makes it much easier to implement a <em><u>garbage collector</u></em>, which is one of the fundamental improvements of Java over C++. And since information about the type of an object is guaranteed to be in all objects, you’ll never end up with an object whose type you cannot determine. This is especially important with system-level operations, such as exception handling, and to allow greater flexibility in programming. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-9-Containers"><a href="#1-9-Containers" class="headerlink" title="1.9 Containers"></a>1.9 Containers</h3><p>The solution to most problems in object-oriented design seems flippant: You create another type of object. The new type of object that solves this particular problem holds references to other objects. Of course, you can do the same thing with an <em><u>array</u></em>, which is available in most languages. But this new object, generally called a container (also called a collection, but the Java library uses that term in a different sense so this book will use “container”), will expand itself whenever necessary to accommodate everything you place inside it. So you don’t need to know how many objects you’re going to hold in a container. Just create a container object and let it take care of the details. </p>
<p>Fortunately, a good OOP language comes with a set of containers as part of the package. In C++, it’s part of the Standard C++ Library and is often called the <em><u>Standard Template Library</u></em> (STL). Smalltalk has a very complete set of containers. Java also has numerous containers in its standard library. In some libraries, one or two generic containers is considered good enough for all needs, and in others (Java, for example) the library has different types of containers for different needs: several different kinds of <strong>List</strong> classes (to hold sequences), <strong>Map</strong>s (also known as associative arrays, to associate objects with other objects), <strong>Set</strong>s (to hold one of each type of object), and more components such as queues, trees, stacks, etc. </p>
<hr>

<h4 id="1-9-1-Parameterized-types-generics"><a href="#1-9-1-Parameterized-types-generics" class="headerlink" title="1.9.1 Parameterized types (generics)"></a>1.9.1 Parameterized types (generics)</h4><p>One of the big changes in Java SE5 is the addition of parameterized types, called generics in Java. You’ll recognize the use of generics by the angle brackets with types inside; for example, an <code>ArrayList</code> that holds <code>Shape</code> can be created like this: </p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ArrayList&lt;Shape&gt; shapes = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="title class_">ArrayList</span>(); </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>There have also been changes to many of the standard library components in order to take advantage of generics. As you will see, generics have an impact on much of the code in this book. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-10-Object-creation-lifetime"><a href="#1-10-Object-creation-lifetime" class="headerlink" title="1.10 Object creation &amp; lifetime"></a>1.10 Object creation &amp; lifetime</h3><p>The dynamic approach makes the generally logical assumption that objects tend to be complicated, so the extra overhead of finding storage and releasing that storage will not have an important impact on the creation of an object. In addition, the greater flexibility is essential to solve the general programming problem. </p>
<p>Java uses dynamic memory allocation, exclusively.7 Every time you want to create an object, you use the <strong>new</strong> operator to build a dynamic instance of that object. </p>
<p>Java provides a feature called a <em><u>garbage collector</u></em> that automatically discovers when an object is no longer in use and destroys it. A garbage collector is much more convenient because it reduces the number of issues that you must track and the code you must write. More importantly, the garbage collector provides a much higher level of insurance against the insidious problem of memory leaks, which has brought many a C++ project to its knees. </p>
<p>With Java, the garbage collector is designed to take care of the problem of releasing the memory (although this doesn’t include other aspects of cleaning up an object). The garbage collector “knows” when an object is no longer in use, and it then automatically releases the memory for that object. This, combined with the fact that all objects are inherited from the single root class <strong>Object</strong> and that you can create objects only one way—on the heap—makes the process of programming in Java much simpler than programming in C++. You have far fewer decisions to make and hurdles to overcome. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="1-11-Exception-handling-dealing-with-errors"><a href="#1-11-Exception-handling-dealing-with-errors" class="headerlink" title="1.11 Exception handling: dealing with errors"></a>1.11 Exception handling: dealing with errors</h3><p>Exception handling wires error handling directly into the programming language and sometimes even the operating system. An exception is an object that is “thrown” from the site of the error and can be “caught” by an appropriate exception handler designed to handle that particular type of error. It’s as if exception handling is a different, parallel path of execution that can be taken when things go wrong. And because it uses a separate execution path, it doesn’t need to interfere with your normally executing code. This tends to make that code simpler to write because you aren’t constantly forced to check for errors. In addition, a thrown exception is unlike an error value that’s returned from a method or a flag that’s set by a method in order to indicate an error condition—these can be ignored. An exception cannot be ignored, so it’s guaranteed to be dealt with at some point. <em><strong>Finally, exceptions provide a way to reliably recover from a bad situation. Instead of just exiting the program, you are often able to set things right and restore execution, which produces much more robust programs.</strong></em> </p>
<p><u><strong>It’s worth noting that exception handling isn’t an object-oriented feature</strong></u>, although in objectoriented languages the exception is normally represented by an object. Exception handling existed before object-oriented languages. </p>

<h3 id="1-12-Concurrent-programming-并发编程"><a href="#1-12-Concurrent-programming-并发编程" class="headerlink" title="1.12 Concurrent programming (并发编程)"></a>1.12 Concurrent programming (并发编程)</h3><p>Sometimes, interrupts are necessary for handling time-critical tasks, but there’s a large class of problems in which you’re simply trying to partition the problem into separately running pieces (tasks) so that the whole program can be more responsive. Within a program, these separately running pieces are called threads, and the general concept is called concurrency. A common example of concurrency is the user interface. By using tasks, a user can press a button and get a quick response rather than being forced to wait until the program finishes its current task. </p>
<p>All this makes concurrency sound pretty simple. There is a catch: <u><strong>shared resources</strong></u>. If you have more than one task running that’s expecting to access the same resource, you have a problem. For example, two processes can’t simultaneously send information to a printer. To solve the problem, resources that can be shared, such as the printer, must be locked while they are being used. So a task locks a resource, completes its task, and then releases the lock so that someone else can use the resource. </p>

<h3 id="1-13-Java-and-the-Internet"><a href="#1-13-Java-and-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="1.13 Java and the Internet"></a>1.13 Java and the Internet</h3><p>Although Java is very useful for solving traditional standalone programming problems, it is also important because <strong><u>it solves programming problems for the World Wide Web</u></strong>. </p>
<hr>

<h4 id="1-13-1-What-is-the-Web"><a href="#1-13-1-What-is-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="1.13.1 What is the Web?"></a>1.13.1 What is the Web?</h4><h5 id="1-Client-server-computing"><a href="#1-Client-server-computing" class="headerlink" title="1. Client&#x2F;server computing"></a>1. Client&#x2F;server computing</h5><p>The primary idea of a client&#x2F;server system is that you have a central repository of information— some kind of data, usually in a database—that you want to distribute on demand to some set of people or machines. A key to the client&#x2F;server concept is that the repository of information is centrally located so that it can be changed and so that those changes will propagate out to the information consumers. Taken together, the information repository, the software that distributes the information, and the machine(s) where the information and software reside are called “*<u>the server</u>*.” The software that resides on the consumer machine, communicates with the server, fetches the information, processes it, and then displays it on the consumer machine is called the <em><u>client</u></em>. </p>
<h5 id="2-The-Web-as-a-giant-server"><a href="#2-The-Web-as-a-giant-server" class="headerlink" title="2. The Web as a giant server"></a>2. The Web as a giant server</h5><p>The Web browser was a big step forward: the concept that <strong><u>one piece of information can be displayed on any type of computer without change</u></strong>. However, the original browsers were still rather primitive and rapidly bogged down by the demands placed on them. They weren’t particularly interactive, and tended to clog up both the server and the Internet because whenever you needed to do something that required programming you had to send information back to the server to be processed. It could take many seconds or minutes to find out you had misspelled something in your request. Since the browser was just a viewer it couldn’t perform even the simplest computing tasks. (On the other hand, it was safe, because it couldn’t execute any programs on your local machine that might contain bugs or viruses.) </p>
<p>To solve this problem, different approaches have been taken. To begin with, graphics standards have been enhanced to allow better animation and video within browsers. The remainder of the problem can be solved only by incorporating the ability to run programs on the client end, under the browser. This is called <em><u>client-side programming</u></em>. </p>
<hr>

<h4 id="1-13-2-Client-side-programming"><a href="#1-13-2-Client-side-programming" class="headerlink" title="1.13.2 Client-side programming"></a>1.13.2 Client-side programming</h4><p>Most desktop computers that run Web browsers are powerful engines capable of doing vast work, and with the original static HTML approach they are sitting there, just idly waiting for the server to dish up the next page. <strong><u>Client-side programming means that the Web browser is harnessed to do whatever work it can, and the result for the user is a much speedier and more interactive experience at your Web site</u></strong>. </p>
<p>The problem with discussions of client-side programming is that they aren’t very different from discussions of programming in general. The parameters are almost the same, but the platform is different; a Web browser is like a limited operating system. In the end, you must still program, and this accounts for the dizzying array of problems and solutions produced by client-side programming. The rest of this section provides an overview of the issues and approaches in client-side programming. </p>

Plug-ins</h5><p>One of the most significant steps forward in client-side programming is the development of the plug-in. This is a way for a programmer to add new functionality to the browser by downloading a piece of code that plugs itself into the appropriate spot in the browser.  The value of the plug-in for client-side programming is that <strong><u>it allows an expert programmer to develop extensions and add those extensions to a browser without the permission of the browser manufacturer</u></strong>. Thus, plug-ins provide a “back door” that allows the creation of new client-side programming languages (although not all languages are implemented as plug-ins). </p>
<h5 id="2-Scripting-languages"><a href="#2-Scripting-languages" class="headerlink" title="2. Scripting languages"></a>2. Scripting languages</h5><p><strong><u>Scripting languages tend to be reasonably easy to understand and, because they are simply text that is part of an HTML page, they load very quickly as part of the single server hit required to procure that page</u></strong>. The trade-off is that your code is exposed for everyone to see (and steal). Generally, however, you aren’t doing amazingly sophisticated things with scripting languages, so this is not too much of a hardship.</p>
<p>The scripting languages used inside Web browsers are really intended to solve specific types of problems, primarily the creation of richer and more interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, a scripting language might solve 80 percent of the problems encountered in client-side programming. Your problems might very well fit completely within that 80 percent, and <u><strong>since scripting languages can allow easier and faster development, you should probably consider a scripting language before looking at a more involved solution such as Java programming</strong></u>. </p>
<h5 id="3-Java"><a href="#3-Java" class="headerlink" title="3. Java"></a>3. Java</h5><p>Java is a popular solution for this. Not only is it a powerful programming language built to be secure, cross-platform, and international, but Java is being continually extended to provide language features and libraries that elegantly handle problems that are difficult in traditional programming languages, such as concurrency, database access, network programming, and distributed computing. Java allows client-side programming via the <em><u>applet</u></em> and with <em><u>Java Web Start</u></em>. </p>
<p>An applet is a mini-program that will run only under a Web browser. The applet is downloaded automatically as part of a Web page (just as, for example, a graphic is automatically downloaded). When the applet is activated, it executes a program. This is part of its beauty—<u><strong>it provides you with a way to automatically distribute the client software from the server at the time the user needs the client software</strong></u>, and no sooner. The user gets the latest version of the client software without fail and without difficult reinstallation. Because of the way Java is designed, the programmer needs to create only a single program, and that program automatically works with all computers that have browsers with built-in Java interpreters. (This safely includes the vast majority of machines.) Since Java is a full-fledged programming language, you can do as much work as possible on the client before and after making requests of the server. For example, you won’t need to send a request form across the Internet to discover that you’ve gotten a date or some other parameter wrong, and your client computer can quickly do the work of plotting data instead of waiting for the server to make a plot and ship a graphic image back to you. Not only do you get the immediate win of speed and responsiveness, but the general network traffic and load on servers can be reduced, preventing the entire Internet from slowing down. </p>
<h5 id="4-Alternatives"><a href="#4-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="4. Alternatives"></a>4. Alternatives</h5><p>To be honest, Java applets have not particularly lived up to their initial fanfare. When Java first appeared, what everyone seemed most excited about was applets, because these would finally allow serious client-side programmability, to increase responsiveness and decrease bandwidth requirements for Internet-based applications. People envisioned vast possibilities. </p>
<p>Indeed, you can find some very clever applets on the Web. But the overwhelming move to applets never happened. The biggest problem was probably that the 10 MB download necessary to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) was too scary for the average user. The fact that Microsoft chose not to include the JRE with Internet Explorer may have sealed its fate. In any event, <strong><u>Java applets didn’t happen on a large scale</u></strong>. </p>
<h5 id="5-NET-and-C"><a href="#5-NET-and-C" class="headerlink" title="5. .NET and C#"></a>5. .NET and C#</h5><p>Currently, the main vulnerability and important question concerning .NET is whether Microsoft will allow it to be completely ported to other platforms. They claim there’s no problem doing this, and the Mono project (<em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.go-mono.com/">www.go-mono.com</a></em>) has a partial implementation of .NET working on Linux, but until the implementation is complete and Microsoft has not decided to squash any part of it, .NET as a cross-platform solution is still a risky bet. </p>
<h5 id="6-Internet-vs-Intranet"><a href="#6-Internet-vs-Intranet" class="headerlink" title="6. Internet vs. Intranet"></a>6. Internet vs. Intranet</h5><p>When Web technology is used for an information network that is restricted to a particular company, it is referred to as an <em><u>intranet</u></em>. Intranets provide much greater security than the Internet, since you can physically control access to the servers within your company.</p>
<p>When faced with this bewildering array of solutions to the client-side programming problem, <strong><u>the best plan of attack is a cost-benefit analysis</u></strong>. Consider the constraints of your problem and what would be the shortest path to your solution. Since client-side programming is still programming, it’s always a good idea to take the fastest development approach for your particular situation. This is an aggressive stance to prepare for inevitable encounters with the problems of program development.</p>

<h4 id="1-13-3-Server-side-programming"><a href="#1-13-3-Server-side-programming" class="headerlink" title="1.13.3 Server-side programming"></a>1.13.3 Server-side programming</h4><p>A more complicated request to a server generally involves a database transaction. A common scenario involves a request for a complex database search, which the server then formats into an HTML page and sends to you as the result. (Of course, if the client has more intelligence via Java or a scripting language, the raw data can be sent and formatted at the client end, which will be faster and less load on the server.) Or you might want to register your name in a database when you join a group or place an order, which will involve changes to that database. These database requests must be processed via some code on the server side, which is generally referred to as server-side programming. Traditionally, server-side programming has been performed using Perl, Python, C++, or some other language to create CGI programs, but more sophisticated systems have since appeared. These include Java-based Web servers that allow you to perform all your server-side programming in Java by writing what are called <em><u>servlets</u></em>. Servlets and their offspring, JSPs, are two of the most compelling reasons that companies that develop Web sites are moving to Java, especially because they eliminate the problems of dealing with differently abled browsers.</p>

<h3 id="1-14-Summary"><a href="#1-14-Summary" class="headerlink" title="1.14 Summary"></a>1.14 Summary</h3><p>Because OOP adds many new concepts on top of what you find in a procedural language, your natural assumption may be that the resulting Java program will be far more complicated than the equivalent procedural program. Here, you’ll be pleasantly surprised: <u><strong>A well-written Java program is generally far simpler and much easier to understand than a procedural program</strong></u>. What you’ll see are <u><strong>the definitions of the objects that represent concepts in your problem space (rather than the issues of the computer representation) and messages sent to those objects to represent the activities in that space</strong></u>. One of the delights of objectoriented programming is that, with a well-designed program, it’s easy to understand the code by reading it. Usually, there’s a lot less code as well, because many of your problems will be solved by <u><strong>reusing existing library code</strong></u>. </p>
<p>OOP and Java may not be for everyone. It’s important to evaluate your own needs and decide whether Java will optimally satisfy those needs, or if you might be better off with another programming system (including the one you’re currently using). If you know that your needs will be very specialized for the foreseeable future and if you have specific constraints that may not be satisfied by Java, then you owe it to yourself to investigate the alternatives (in particular, I recommend looking at Python; see <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.python.org/">www.Python.org</a></em>). If you still choose Java as your language, <u><strong>you’ll at least understand what the options were and have a clear vision of why you took that direction.</strong></u> </p>
